# Extension Migration Documentation

## Project Context

This extension (`compressed-log-viewer`) is the successor to the original `xz-log-viewer` extension, created to support multiple compressed file formats.

## Migration Strategy

**Original Situation:**
- We had a working VS Code extension that handled `.xz` and `.tar.xz` files
- Need arose to support additional compression formats (specifically `bzip2`)

**Decision Made:**
- Instead of modifying the existing extension, we decided to create a new multi-format extension
- The original `xz-log-viewer` extension will be marked as deprecated in the VS Code marketplace
- Users will be directed to migrate to this new `compressed-log-viewer` extension

## Implementation Approach

**Codebase Creation:**
- This codebase was created by copying the entire `xz-log-viewer` project
- All original functionality for XZ files is preserved
- The architecture is already suitable for adding additional compression formats

**Planned Changes:**
1. Update project metadata (name, description, package.json)
2. Add bzip2 decompression support alongside existing XZ functionality
3. Update file associations and commands to handle multiple formats
4. Maintain the same `TextDocumentContentProvider` architecture pattern

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Clean Migration**: Users get a new extension without breaking existing workflows
- **Backward Compatibility**: All XZ functionality remains intact
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easy to add more compression formats in the future
- **Clear Deprecation Path**: Original extension can be cleanly deprecated with migration instructions

## Development Notes

- The core `XZFileProvider` class and `TextDocumentContentProvider` pattern work well for any compression format
- Main changes will be in the decompression logic and file association configurations
- UI/UX patterns and VS Code integration remain the same

This approach ensures a smooth transition for existing users while providing a foundation for supporting multiple compression formats going forward.
